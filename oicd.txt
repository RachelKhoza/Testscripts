Architecture Overview
	1.	GitHub Actions serves as the CI/CD workflow engine.
	2.	OIDC Provider: GitHub provides OIDC tokens to authenticate workflows.
	3.	AWS IAM Role: AWS validates OIDC tokens and issues temporary credentials.
	4.	Temporary Credentials: These credentials are used by GitHub Actions to interact with AWS resources.

Step-by-Step Guide

Step 1: Configure the OIDC Provider in AWS
	1.	Login to AWS Console:
	•	Navigate to IAM > Identity Providers > Add Provider.
	2.	Create OIDC Provider:
	•	Choose OpenID Connect as the provider type.
	•	Enter the following:
	•	Provider URL: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
	•	Audience: sts.amazonaws.com
	3.	Save Changes:
	•	Note the ARN of the OIDC provider for later steps.


Step 2: Create an IAM Role for GitHub Actions
	1.	Create the Role:
	•	In AWS IAM, select Roles > Create Role.
	•	Choose Web Identity as the trusted entity.
	•	Select the OIDC provider created earlier.
	2.	Set Trust Policy:
Use the following trust policy to restrict access to specific GitHub repositories and workflows:

Benefits of This Approach
	•	No Hard-Coded Credentials: Credentials are dynamically obtained during the workflow.
	•	Fine-Grained Access: IAM role policies enforce least-privilege access.
	•	Enhanced Security: Tokens are short-lived and scoped to specific workflows.
