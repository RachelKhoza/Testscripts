2.	AWS WAF Web ACL:
•	Purpose: Protects your web application from common web attacks and controls traffic based on custom rules.
•	Configuration:
•	Managed Rules: Use AWS-managed rule groups for basic protections, such as the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
•	Custom Rules: Add custom rules (e.g., rate-limiting or specific IP blocking).
•	Rate-Based Rules: Implement rate-based rules to limit requests from any single IP and help mitigate DDoS attacks.
•	Association: Attach the Web ACL to the ALB, ensuring that all traffic passing through the ALB is filtered by WAF.
3.	CloudWatch Logging:
•	Purpose: Stores detailed WAF logs for monitoring, troubleshooting, and compliance purposes.
•	Configuration:
•	Log Group: Create a CloudWatch Log Group for WAF logs, and set a retention period (at least 365 days is recommended for compliance).
•	KMS Encryption: Encrypt the log group with an AWS KMS key to ensure data confidentiality.
•	Logging Configuration: Use aws_wafv2_web_acl_logging_configuration in Terraform to configure WAF to log to CloudWatch.
4.	CloudWatch Metrics and Alarms:
•	Purpose: Enable monitoring for suspicious activity or traffic spikes.
•	Configuration:
•	Metrics: Enable metrics for specific WAF rules (e.g., rate-limiting) to monitor rule triggers.
•	Alarms: Set up CloudWatch alarms to notify when there’s unusual activity, such as repeated blocked requests.

Terraform Configuration Example

Here’s an example configuration in Terraform for implementing AWS WAF with ALB and CloudWatch logging.
