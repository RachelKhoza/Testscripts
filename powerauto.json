Power Automate Flow for Checking and Clearing Lab Room Bookings

Overview

This flow automates the process of checking lab room bookings, updating availability, and clearing outdated fields in a SharePoint list.

Flow Setup

	1.	Recurrence Trigger
	•	Configure the flow to run at desired intervals (e.g., daily) using a Recurrence trigger.
	2.	Get Current Date and Time
	•	Add a Compose action with utcNow() to retrieve the current date and time. This will be used to check against booking dates.
	3.	Get Items
	•	Use Get Items action with an OData filter to retrieve SharePoint items where the “Booked Till” date is less than the current date (utcNow()).
	4.	Apply to Each
	•	Insert an Apply to each action, using the output of Get Items. This loop iterates over each outdated booking.
	5.	Update Item
	•	Add an Update item action inside the loop.
	•	Status: Set to “Available”.
	•	Clear Fields:
	•	Date and User Fields: Set fields like Booked Till and BookedBy to null using the expression panel to clear them.
